# Exploring Line Types in OpenCV

Recently, while giving a presentation on the basics of OpenCV using Python I came around the various [Line Types](https://www.docs.opencv.org/trunk/d6/d6e/group__imgproc__draw.html#gaf076ef45de481ac96e0ab3dc2c29a777) and it wasn't immediately evident what they meant or what they were used for.
Then, I searched the internet and their too, not much was available directly. 
Hence, I decided to do some experimentation and so here is what I found.

First up is the code:

	# Importing necessary modules
	import cv2
	import numpy as np

	# Create an empty black image of 600px x 600px
	pic = np.zeros((600, 600, 3), np.uint8)

	# Create circles with different centres, colours and line types, 30px radius
	# and 1 px width
	pic = cv2.circle(pic, (100, 100), 30, (0, 255, 0), 1, cv2.LINE_8)
	pic = cv2.circle(pic, (200, 200), 30, (255, 0, 0), 1, cv2.LINE_4)
	pic = cv2.circle(pic, (300, 300), 30, (0, 0, 255), 1, cv2.LINE_AA)
	pic = cv2.circle(pic, (400, 400), 30, (0, 255, 255), 1, cv2.FILLED)

	# Show the image in a window
	cv2.imshow("pic",pic)

	# Wait for any key to be pressed
	cv2.waitKey(0)

	# Save the image
	cv2.imwrite("line_test.png",pic)

I have explained each line in comments so I won't be talking much about the code now. Rather, we shall dicuss the result which is this:

![](line_test.png)

In the first glance, you won't be able to tell any difference between the circles apart from their colours. So let's zoom in into each of the circle.

![line_8](line_8.png)

This is the circle generated by the cv2.LINE_8 option, which is the default option. It's called a 8-connected line. 

Upon deeper research, I found that this LineType argument actually species the line drawing algorithm/pixel connectivity that should be used for creating the line. So LINE_8, or 8-connected line, means that this line was created by using the [Bresenham's line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm) with [8-connected pixel connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_connectivity#8-connected). This means that for every pixel, it's all the 8 surrounding pixels are considered a neighbour. And it's because of that, that we see a bit of a point, the diagonal pixel, at the 4 coordinates that lie on the axis (considering the centre as origin).

This concept is closely related to [Moore Neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) which is used in the famous [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

![line_4](line_4.png)

Now this here is a 4-connected line. Very very similar to 8-connected line, only that now you have only the 4 adjacent pixels as your neighbour. Also knon as [
4 connected pixel connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_connectivity#4-connected) this concept is closely related to [Von Neumann neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_neighborhood)

![line_aa](line_aa.png)

This one though is a different thing altogether. It's an antialiased line. The two above were aliased lines. It is made using the [Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolin_Wu%27s_line_algorithm). What basically happens is that after drawing the normal line, we paint the neighbouring pixels a shade of the colour and the shade is proportional to the distance from the actual line which you might observe in the pic.

Now I don't know what this is. From the name, it should fill the circle but it isn't doing that. In fact from the looks of it, it is the 4-connected line again. Naturally I wasn't satisfied and dug a bit deeper. I printed it's value cause apparantly all these constants are just integers. So we got:

- cv2.FILLED = -1
- cv2.LINE_4 = 4
- cv2.LINE_8 = 8
- cv2.LINE_AA = 16

And it turns out that FILLED is useful when passed as the thickness parameter cause anything below 1 will fill the shape:

	pic = cv2.circle(pic, (400, 400), 30, (0, 255, 255), cv2.FILLED, cv2.FILLED)

And so ends my experiment. I think I know enough about the LineType argument. And by the way, now that I think about it, we were taught the Bresenham algorithm and 4 and 8-connected pixels as part of the Computer Graphics course in our last semester.

Sorry, couldn't find a relatable comic this time. So here is my life summed up:
