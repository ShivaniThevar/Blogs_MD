<h1 id="eyantra-diaries-intro">Eyantra Diaries: Intro</h1>
<p>So we participated in the e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) 2019-20. And it was/is a good experience so I thought I should share it. This is just the intro post, where I will talk about how I happened to participate in it and stuff like that. This series will mostly be narrative in nature, with technical stuff about my work in the competition popping here and there. So let’s begin laying the foundation of the posts to come.</p>
<h1 id="whats-this-eyantra">What’s this Eyantra?</h1>
<p>E-yantra stands for Electronic Yantra (hindi for gadget). So <a href="https://www.e-yantra.org/">eYRC</a> an initiative by IIT Bombay that aims to create the next generation of embedded systems engineers with a practical outlook to help provide practical solutions to some of the real world problems.</p>
<p>But for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagmeet-singh-921a8a16a/">Jagmeet</a> it was an opportunity, to finally get his hands on some good project/competition. Well, that’s a bit of a letdown of Electronics and Communication Engineering that you don’t get to do much projects unless you are ready to throw in some of that gold. And being the sticky friends that we are, me and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akmecha/">Alok</a> couldn’t have let him go alone on this adventure.</p>
<p>The fourth member (yeah you need a team of 4) of our team was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/puran-singh-channa-ba1a51166/">Puran</a> who is Jagmeet’s classmate. Being a bit honest, initially I wasn’t much open to Puran cause he was a stranger to me and that’s just how I am.</p>
<p>And while I am at it, a shoutout to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham-baranwal-5a47b7149/">Shubham Barnwal</a> who is our senior and who introduced us (and our college) to eYRC. In the eYRC 2018-19, his team bagged the 5th position and he wanted more students from our college to participate and made honest efforts for that. Thanks sir!!!</p>
<h1 id="stage-0">Stage 0</h1>
<p>After all the registration process (which obviously Jagmeet did as he was the team leader), the first big hurdle to cross is the Apptitude test which all the 4 team mates have to give simulaneously and that’s what made it a challenge. The tests has questions from basic programming (C language), basic electronics and some aptitude questions.</p>
<p>With our diverse team, it wasn’t that difficult though and I don’t think marks were revealed, but we did pretty good and qualified for Stage 1 (yay!) and now the real stuff was about to begin.</p>
<p>And to continue the tradition from my training days:</p>
