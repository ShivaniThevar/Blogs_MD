# Creating Report using Latex

I have known about Latex for quite a time now but never got the opportunity to actually use it. 
But then I got the work to create a format for all the reports of Indian Society for Technical Education (ISTE).
Initially I tried doing that with the help of Google Docs, but it wasn't portable as the format was completely destroyed when anyone opened it in MS Word or LibreOffice Word.
Then I realised that there isn't any better portable document than PDF and what better way to create a PDF than using Latex.
And to add icing to the cake, my friend [Alok](www.github.com/AkMecha) recently gave a presentation on Latex.
