<p>So after having a basic GUI to list all the examples, we had to catergories them based on their properties. The properties of a FEM example include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Constraints: The type of <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/FEM_Module#Electrostatic_Constraints">constraints</a> being used in the example.</li>
<li>Equations: What is the type of equation (mechanical, thermal, electrostatic, etc) being solved in the example.</li>
<li>Materials: The type of <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/FEM_Module#Materials">material</a> the model in the example is made of.</li>
<li>Mesh: What is the shape of the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/FEM_Mesh#Mesh_elements_in_FreeCAD">elements</a> of the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/FEM_Mesh">mesh</a>.</li>
<li>Solvers: Which <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/FEM_Solver">solvers</a> present in FEM workbench can solve the example.</li>
</ol>
<p>For getting these information from the examples, we decided to add a convinience method <code>get_information()</code> which would return us a dictionary containing all the information of the example. But there was a catch here! To use this method, I would need to import the example modules. And while this can be as simple as <code>from example import get_information</code> we can’t do that. Why? Cause the list of examples is meant to grow so it has to be dynamic. Also, the simple way would require us to think of unique names for the <code>get_information</code> of each example which is a tedious task. So I searched and found that we can dynamically import modules using <code>importlib</code> package. Further we can use <code>getattr()</code> method to get the method from a module and execute it. Thus, we built a GUI that dynamically loads all the examples that have a <code>get_information</code> method, classifies and displays them. This removes the need to register any new example and also simplifies the testing of an example during it’s making. It was quite a satisfaction to make this GUI.</p>
<p>Besides that, nothing much happened. I finally got the rebase right. And the hinged beam example I mentioned earlier was completed (yet to be tested). Major learnings would be <code>QTreeWidgetItem</code>, <code>importlib</code> and <code>patience</code> :).</p>
<p>And with no relation to this post, here is a nice xkcd:</p>
