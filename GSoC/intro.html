<h1 class="title">GSoC Days: Intro</h1>
</header>
<p>Yeah, I was selected in GSoC 2020. ;-) And if you don’t know, GSoC stands for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a>. Basically students contribute to open source during 3 months of GSoC. And as always, I would be talking about my experience working in GSoC with <a href="https://freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a> in this and the following blogs. This one would be just an intro though.</p>
<p>If you know GSoC, you know that the toughest part is to get selected! The <a href="https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/making-first-contact#">selection process</a> is an elaborate one not everyone is selected. Well a lot of factors play a role in selection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is your proposal good enough?</li>
<li>Does the organisation need your proposed project?</li>
<li>How good is your profile?</li>
<li>Have you contributed to that organisation before?</li>
<li>Did you get in touch with them while applying?</li>
<li>How many slots does the organisation get? etc… etc…</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="freecad">FreeCAD</h2>
<p>So my orgainsation is FreeCAD (which comes under the umbrella of BRL-CAD). I had applied for FreeCAD in GSoC 2019 too, but that project wasn’t selected. To be very honest I had no plans of applying in this GSoC, mostly because I had no projects to go with. But few days before the application period would end, <a href="https://github.com/SurajDadral">Suraj</a> told me that there is a project in FreeCAD on which I can apply. Seizing the opportunity, I quickly wrote a proposal for it with the help from <a href="https://github.com/berndhahnebach">Bernd</a>. And it got <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6143233156972544">selected</a>!!! Thanks Suraj for informing me about the project. :)</p>
<h2 id="the-project">The Project</h2>
<p>So our project is to extend the examples present in the <a href="https://wiki.freecadweb.org/FEM_Module">Finite Element Method (FEM) Workbench</a> of FreeCAD. This means we will add various examples, which show the true capabilities of the FEM workbench. The plan is also to add more capabilities (constraints and equations) in FreeCAD and test them using examples. And examples are also to find and resolve the hidden bugs that might creep in during the continous and extensive development of the workbench. So you see, it’s quite a simple but elegant project idea from Bernd.</p>
<p>In the coming posts, we will follow the journey of this project in a weekly manner.</p>
