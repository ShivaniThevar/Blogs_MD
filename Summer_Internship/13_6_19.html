<p><em>Date: June 13th, 2019</em></p>
<h3 id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h3>
<p>Now that the code had successfully executed, I had to think &quot;what's next?&quot; Thinking thoroughly for a few minutes, I realised a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What me and my code was doing till now, was a training phase. We were processing large amount of data to learn from it, and then test what we learnt on another set of data. Every time the code would be executed, it would start from zero, learn everything up and apply what it learnt. That isn't what we actually want. That's not how &quot;learning&quot; happens. Every time you want to write a sentence in English, you don't go and learn all of English alphabets and grammar again. You just apply what you have already learnt. So once you learn a thing, you save it somewhere (in the brain actually). And that's what the code should do. It should learn once, <strong>save</strong> what it learnt and then apply it. So after training our ML model, its required to save it or you can say export it. And <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/save-load-machine-learning-models-python-scikit-learn/">this</a> is how you save your ML model. And along with the model, we should save our dictionary too, cause that's our &quot;vocabulary&quot; that we have built up in our learning process.</p></li>
<li><p>Now learning isn't a one time process. Its continuous. Every time you make a mistake, you look back and fine tune what you had learnt. This &quot;self-correcting&quot; feature was required to be added in the code. But then again, this would only work if you save your knowledge, your ML model that is.</p></li>
<li><p>Till now, we were working on a publicly available, preprocessed dataset called the Ling-spam corpus. But isn't the actual data we are supposed to process. Our actual data are &quot;pure&quot; mails. So we need to build our own preprocessor that would clean the mail, as I would describe in a separate blog, so that we are left with much less and precise data to work with.</p></li>
<li><p>The results obtained were good as per the article I was following. But there should be a way to manually test results. I am talking about a result where it is specified which mail the code is classifying as ham ans which as spam. I thought of a way of doing this in the current code, but that was too much of work because we are working with large amount of data here. This task would be simpler on a per mail basis, where we read a single mail and classify it as spam or ham. And isn't that out end goal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So my chain of thoughts brought me to the conclusion that our current code's purpose is to only produce the dictionary and ML model. This isn't our end goal. Our end goal would work on a per mail basis and do the following things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the incoming mail.</li>
<li>Preprocess it.</li>
<li>Load the dictionary.</li>
<li>Extract features from that mail.</li>
<li>Load the ML model.</li>
<li>Classify the mail and put it in the respective folder (inbox or spam).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="getting-my-own-mail-server">Getting my own Mail Server</h3>
<p>And to build this code, it was first required that I know the working of mail server. Because we have to intercept the mail before it reached the inbox. So I decided to install my own mail server on my server because why not!</p>
<p>I found this useful <a href="https://appbead.com/blog/how-to-setup-mail-server-on-debian-8-jessie-with-postfix-dovecot-1.html">guide</a> that explains both how a mail server works and how to set it up. A round of applause for Mo Nianliang, the who wrote the guide.</p>
<p>So following along the guide, I had one issue. I didn't had a valid <a href="https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate/">SSL Certificate</a>. The link given in the guide had expired. Asking my head about it, he advised me to use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, a site offering free SSL certificates. I followed the procedure there, but ended up in a tough position because I didn't had a valid domain name for my server. But again, my server was in a local network, inaccessible from the internet. What to do now?</p>
<p>I had recently heard about <a href="http://xip.io/">xip.io</a>, a great free service that allows you to resolve local addresses through the internet. This should have worked for me. But guess what:</p>
<pre><code>An unexpected error occurred:
There were too many requests of a given type :: Error creating new order :: too many certificates already issued for: xip.io:</code></pre>
<p>People out there are smarter than us!!!</p>
<p>So thinking about whether I should go for an insecure installation or not, I packed up and left the office. Oh and here is a Linux joke comic before I reach my PG:</p>
