<h1 id="day-11-of-summer-internship">Day 11 of Summer Internship</h1>
<p><em>Date: June 17th, 2019</em></p>
<p>The day started with research. Searching on the possible solutions of the certificate error that I was facing. To connect to the server, I tried telnet but was getting thrown out of the server: sudhanshu@dubey:~$ telnet local.nebero 143 Trying 10.1.1.153... Connected to local.nebero. Escape character is '^]'. Connection closed by foreign host.</p>
<p>And trying to connect with openssl gave the following: openssl: sudhanshu@dubey:~$ openssl s_client -connect local.nebero:143 CONNECTED(00000003) write:errno=104 --- no peer certificate available --- No client certificate CA names sent --- SSL handshake has read 0 bytes and written 176 bytes ...</p>
<p>Clearly, my server was not responding because its certificate was not correctly configured. Another indication of this was when I ran the command: service dovecot status</p>
<p>And got this: dovecot[15625]: imap-login: Fatal: Can't load ssl_cert: There is no valid PEM certificate. dovecot[15623]: master: Error: service(imap-login): command startup failed, throttling for 2 secs</p>
<p>So the certificate that I had generated was not acceptable to dovecot. Quite the demanding little package if you ask me. Wandering around the internet in search of a possible solution, I reached the <a href="https://wiki.dovecot.org/FrontPage">official documentation</a>, somewhere I should have visited much earlier, and got this guide on <a href="https://wiki.dovecot.org/SSL/CertificateCreation">SSL certificate creation</a>. Turns out they are not so bad as they had created a script just to create the certificate. Following their instructions, I executed their script but unfortunately even that gave the error: unable to get 'local.nebero' section</p>
<p>So I searched again for this error, but nothing much showed up. Finally some more useless attempts to search for a solution online, I decided to run the commands in the script, but manually one by one. So I executed: openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out dovecot.pem -keyout dovecot.key.pem</p>
<p>Which is slightly different from the one given in the guide. I will discuss about this difference in a different blog where we will discuss this whole process of setting up the mail server. Finally I restarted the services and connecting from my local system I got this beautiful output:</p>
<pre><code>sudhanshu@dubey:~$ openssl s_client -connect local.nebero:993
CONNECTED(00000003)
...

* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=LOGIN] Dovecot ready.</code></pre>
<p>But a login attempt failed:</p>
<pre><code>* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=LOGIN] Dovecot ready.

a NO [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Authentication failed.
a login root@local.nebero &lt;password&gt;
a NO [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Authentication failed.
* BYE Disconnected for inactivity.
closed</code></pre>
<p>Searching again for possible causes for this, I tried to create a new user and found the reason. The strange command that the guide was using to create users: cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt;&gt; /etc/dovecot/users</p>
<p>Was actually at fault. It was, for some strange reason, not putting whole of hashed password in the file. So I removed all the data from the file and manually entered the users and password. Which finally enabled me to successfully login using ssl:</p>
<pre><code>* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=LOGIN] Dovecot ready.
a login suraj@local.nebero user@123
a OK [...] 
a logout
* BYE Logging out
a OK Logout completed (0.000 + 0.000 secs).
closed</code></pre>
<p>But then again, the mail was not sent:</p>
<pre><code>sudhanshu@dubey:~$  echo &quot;Subject: sendmail test&quot; | sendmail -v suraj@local.nebero
...
250-dubey Hello localhost [127.0.0.1], pleased to meet you

<p>Tired as I was at that time I left the day at this. Also, the beautiful rainy weather was calling out for me so I had no other option. And while I enjoy the sweet breeze outside, you guys can enjoy this comic:</p>
