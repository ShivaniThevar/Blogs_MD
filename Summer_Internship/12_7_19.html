		<p><em>Date: July 12th, 2019</em></p>
		<p>My project had already finished to a satisfactory extent. I didn’t had much work to do today, and I wasn’t in the mood anyway. Ah, there was one thing though, the project report. I had to write the project report and submit it to the company and the college. Yesterday I had found <a href="https://cse.gndec.ac.in/sites/default/files/Six%20Week%20Industrial%20Training%20format%20Guidelines_1.pdf">this guideline</a> on our college’s website. And the best thing was that at the end, they have given this <a href="https://github.com/sukhjitsehra/trainingreport/tree/master/trainingReport">LaTeX templete</a> for us to use. And what could be a better tool to write reports than <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. So I immediately cloned the repo and though it’s 3 years old, I have to say that it’s nicely structured.</p>
		<p>I immediately edited the first few pages where only some fields were to be edited. But then it came to “Abstract” and I wasn’t sure what to write there. So I skipped that came to the major part, the chapters. And just as I started writing the chapters, I was blank. Nothing came to my mind. As I have told you earlier, I just wasn’t in the mood. And when I am not in a mood to do something, (no I don’t sit idle), I just do something else. Time is of essence and I have lot’s of things to do.</p>
		<p>And the day (my last full-day in the office) went just like that, me helping my colleagues solve their problems and doing some other works. And you know what happens when you try to solve problems, you get more of them:</p>
