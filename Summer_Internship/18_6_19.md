# Day 12 of Summer Internship

*Date: June 18th, 2019*

Searching for a reason why my Dovecot users were not being accepted as a mail recipient as described in the error here:

	sudhanshu@dubey:~$  echo "Subject: sendmail test" | sendmail -v suraj@local.nebero
	...
	250-dubey Hello localhost [127.0.0.1], pleased to meet you
	...
	550 5.1.1 <suraj@local.nebero>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table
	554 5.5.1 Error: no valid recipients
	...

I reached doorsteps of one of the most helpful friend of programmers, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42181669/postfix-recipient-address-rejected-user-unknown-in-local-recipient-table) (Thank you StackOverflow and all other StackExchange sites to always be there for us). I followed the solution there and kept the value of ``local_recipient_maps`` blank in ``/etc/postfix/main.cf``. Then, finally this happened:

	050 >>> MAIL From:<sudhanshu@dubey> SIZE=283 AUTH=<>
	050 250 2.1.0 Ok
	050 >>> RCPT To:<suraj@local.nebero>
	050 >>> DATA
	050 250 2.1.5 Ok
	050 354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
	050 >>> .
	050 250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as BC3AF40B47
	050 <suraj@local.nebero>... Sent (Ok: queued as BC3AF40B47)
	250 2.0.0 x5J68hti011355 Message accepted for delivery
	suraj@local.nebero... Sent (x5J68hti011355 Message accepted for delivery)
	Closing connection to [127.0.0.1]
	>>> QUIT

And though it was a happy signal, but I couldn't see the mail I sent in the folder where it should have gone. So, I checked the mail queue:

	root@bhav:~# postqueue -p
	Mail queue is empty
	root@bhav:~# mailq 
	Mail queue is empty

Then, obviously, I checked the logs (and that's what everyone should do when faced with abnormalities):

	 postfix/smtpd[24198]: connect from unknown[10.1.1.111]
	 postfix/smtpd[24198]: BC3AF40B47: client=unknown[10.1.1.111]
	 postfix/cleanup[24204]: BC3AF40B47: message-id=<201906190608.x5J68hlb011332@dubey>
	 postfix/qmgr[24178]: BC3AF40B47: from=<sudhanshu@dubey>, size=638, nrcpt=1 (queue active)
	 postfix/local[24205]: BC3AF40B47: to=<suraj@local.nebero>, relay=local, delay=0.11, delays=0.08/0.01/0/0.01, dsn=5.1.1, status=bounced (unknown user: "suraj")
	 postfix/bounce[24206]: BC3AF40B47: sender non-delivery notification: D519640B49
	 postfix/qmgr[24178]: BC3AF40B47: removed

So it seems that postfix is not recognising the user "suraj". But how come? I had just yesterday logged in with this username and password and it was ok. This thought perplexed me for sometime and then I realised the mistake I was making in my thought process. Yesterday I had connected to port 993, where the protocol was IMAPS which was under the control of Dovecot. But this mail is being sent to port 25, where the protocol is SMTP which is under the control of Postfix. So Postfix to the Dovecot users is like:

Now Dovecot is recognising it's users but Postfix is not recognising the Dovecot's users. Quite obviously the error is there in the connectivity of these two softwares. I did some research to find the solution, even read the official documentation of both [Dovecot](https://wiki.dovecot.org/HowTo/PostfixAndDovecotSASL) and [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/SASL_README.html#server_dovecot) but couldn't find anything much useful.

So leaving things as they were, I decided to go for a distribution upgrade from Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) to 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish) because that's a necessary step to for updating ultimately to 19.04 (Disco Dingo). So I started that process, which ultimately took around to 7 hrs to complete!!! 

But do I like the Cuttlefish? Yeah, I love it even though I am a vegetarian! It's allowing me run Android Studio along with Firefox which I was not able to do in the Beaver as it hanged. But then again, looks like Cuttlefish can handle only 2 tabs as opening the third one hanged the system and I had to REISUB. Overall, I am now planning to experience Cuttlefish for this June and shift to Dingo in the July as support for Cuttlefish will stop in July. And while I enjoy Cuttlefish, why don't you enjoy this comic:

PS: The image is big enough, just zoom it or else you won't be able to fix your Linux.
