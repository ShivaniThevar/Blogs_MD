# Day 23 of Summer Internship

*Date: July 1st, 2019*

Today I found the solution of our yesterday's problem. The thing is that Doxygen only considers those files for documentation that have [@file](http://doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdfile) or [@package](http://doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdpackage) at the beginning. So adding that helped me to utilise the other special commands. And one by one, I started documenting all of my files.

Now if I haven't told you guys already, 3 other students from college also joined around a week ago for their 6 moths training. They were basically learning [Dart](https://dart.dev/) for now. It's basically a language to create fast apps on multiple platforms, developed by google. So though they were going good with MS Windows, but there were eventually problems. And to solve them, we required cmd which wasn't really helpful. Then, after taking everyone's consent, they decided to switch to Linux. And the responsibility to guide them through this and get the Linux basics clear was on me. So we decided to do this today. On by one, we installed Ubuntu 18.04 into their laptops. And for some reason, none of the system's Grub was automatically configured to include Windows boot image. So after teaching them basic Linux commands, we used [Boot-repair](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair) utility to create a new Grub for EFI mode (the earlier was of Legacy mode). And that got their dual-booted system ready.

After that, they got going with their dart work, and I continued my documentation still waiting for ham mails. Then my head visited me, informing me that they won't be able to provide ham mails to me from their servers as it will be against the privacy rights of the costumers. So now I had to get my mails from my Gmail account and then test the code on them. He also mentioned that for integrating the code with the mail server, I should make deamon on the system that would check for new mails(files) in the mail directory and then call the code if a new file is detected. This idea looked good to me. And another good idea was to compare programming languages as if they were essays:

My favourite was shell essay. How did I read it you ask, well sudo all the way!
You can even find this essay analogy for other languages [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/fqtqk/if_programming_languages_were_essays/)
