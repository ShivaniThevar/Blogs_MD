<p><em>Date: June 29th, 2019</em></p>
<p>Being a Saturday, today was a rather light day and not much work was done by me. I was still waiting for the ham mails to test my software. While waiting, I thought that I should write the documentation of the software. I had earlier started this work, using doxygen. The fact that doxygen wasn’t originally meant for python was a bit of problem. Though they have recently added support for python, but they still don’t support <a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmd_intro">special commands</a> in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#what-is-a-docstring">docstrings</a> as per their <a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html#pythonblocks">official documentation</a>. So I rather used “#” for using the special commands. But even that wasn’t working. I wanted to use the special commands like <span class="citation" data-cites="author">[@author]</span>(http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdauthor), <span class="citation" data-cites="date">[@date]</span>(http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmddate), <span class="citation" data-cites="bugs">[@bugs]</span>(http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdbug) and other such commands. But doxygen just wasn’t picking them.</p>
<p>I searched the internet, but couldn’t find any clear solution. I will try again tomorrow with a new zeal. And if you are wondering why I am focusing so much on the documentation, well here is why:</p>
