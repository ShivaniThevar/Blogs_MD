# Day 22 of Summer Internship

*Date: June 29th, 2019*

Being a Saturday, today was a rather light day and not much work was done by me. I was still waiting for the ham mails to test my software. While waiting, I thought that I should write the documentation of the software. I had earlier started this work, using doxygen. The fact that doxygen wasn't originally meant for python was a bit of problem. Though they have recently added support for python, but they still don't support [special commands](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmd_intro) in [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#what-is-a-docstring) as per their [official documentation](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html#pythonblocks). So I rather used "#" for using the special commands. But even that wasn't working. I wanted to use the special commands like [@author](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdauthor), [@date](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmddate), [@bugs](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmdbug) and other such commands. But doxygen just wasn't picking them.

I searched the internet, but couldn't find any clear solution. I will try again tomorrow with a new zeal. And if you are wondering why I am focusing so much on the documentation, well here is why:
