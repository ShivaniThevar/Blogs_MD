<p>Now here is the new part. Till now, we were running the code as and when we wanted. It had to always be executed, and it will stop after finishing the execution or if an error occurred. But that’s not how it is supposed to be. In the end, our code should run indefinitely, always checking for a new mail and filter it as it comes. So as you can realize, we need to keep monitoring a directory where new mails come. And as they land in that directory, we need to filter them using our code. So what we need is a “monitor”.</p>
<p>Searching around the internet, I found <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/inotifywait">inotifywait</a> on the StackOverflow. And though there were other solutions too, but most of the people were praising this one, so I went with this. What inotifywait does is that it waits for changes in a directory which it supposed to watch. It the required changes happen, then it notifies the user. Now, there are two ways of notifying the user, one is through the active terminal in which inotifywait is running. The other is to put the results in a log file if it is running in the background. And the later one is our preferred way. Now, even though, inotifywait tells us 3 things about the changes in the directory we made it so that we get the full address of the new mails that will arrive because that’s what we need.</p>
<p>Now after getting the address of the mails in a log file, I had to modify the python code so that it would continuously read that log file, pick the new mail’s address from there, process that mail and give the result. Basically I wanted functionality similar to “tail -f”. Now if you are asking why don’t I use “tail -f” and the call the python code? Well there is a reason why I want my python code to execute continuously. If I were to execute the code again and again, it will load the ML model, the dictionary and the SpaCy modules again and again. And this will require time. So what I want is that on the first execution, it will load all these things once and then as the mails come, keep filtering them. For this I again visited the internet and got the answer from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25537237/python-read-file-continuously-even-after-it-has-been-logrotated">here</a>. This was, INHO, a brilliant solution and it worked perfectly for me.</p>
<p>There were a few concerns though. On every initial execution, the log file should be completely empty, in fact brand new. Also, if the changes are made too fast in the log file, python will read too many file names and then there would be IOerror as it will try to read too many files at once. So I am yet to find a solution for these. I will have to acquire new thoughts and skills to get the solution of these small issues. And you know what happens after we learn new skills:</p>
