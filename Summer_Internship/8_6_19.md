# Day 5 of Summer Internship

*Date: June 8th, 2019*

Saturday, but I still had a working day today. Well not like I had a problem with it, in fact I will prefer working over staying idle in the PG.
But being Saturday, the developers were on a holiday and so was my head.
So I had to handle much of things by myself.

I still had the UnicodeDecodeError from yesterday to deal with. So I searched the internet and found the following things:

1. [**file -i**](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ufile.htm) : A Linux command that detects type of file. With the -i flag, it prints the mime type strings. So using this I got:

	sudhanshu@dubey:/media/sudhanshu/Thunder/Repos/spam_filter$ file -i train-mails/3-1msg1.txt 
	train-mails/3-1msg1.txt: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

2. [**chardet**](https://pypi.org/project/chardet/): This is an open-source python library that can detect character encoding.

I decided to use this in my code to first find the character encoding of a given mail and then process as such. But I ran into a problem. The open() method was returning the object of type \_io.TextIOWrapper and the chardet.detect() method only takes bytes or bytearray as input (or so it said). I tried various coversion methods but in vain.
So chardet.detect() didn't proved much helpful for me and I was still stuck with that error.

Being a Saturday, the atmosphere in the office was light and playful. Not finding a way around the error, I sat down to write blog posts after the lunch.

While trying out chardet, I had noticed that I was getting IndentationError sometimes. Indentation is always a big issue in Python. So I decided to use [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) to properly format my code. You can check [here](https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/what-is-flake8-and-why-we-should-use-it-b89bd78073f2) to know what is flake8 and why should you use it.
But I love my vim and so I decided to integrate flake8 in vim itself. And I found just the right thing in [vim-flake8](https://github.com/nvie/vim-flake8). 

I followed their instructions to properly setup and configure vim-flake8 which involved installing [vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) (A runtime path and plugin manager for vim) and that completed my previously incomplete installation of [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) (A code-completion engine for Vim).

So it was quite a beneficial thing to do. ;-)
