# Day 11 of Summer Internship

*Date: June 17th, 2019*

The day started with research. Searching on the possible solutions of the certificate error that I was facing. To connect to the server, I tried telnet but was getting thrown out of the server:
	sudhanshu@dubey:~$ telnet local.nebero 143
	Trying 10.1.1.153...
	Connected to local.nebero.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	Connection closed by foreign host.

And trying to connect with openssl gave the following:
	openssl: sudhanshu@dubey:~$ openssl s_client -connect local.nebero:143
	CONNECTED(00000003)
	write:errno=104
	---
	no peer certificate available
	---
	No client certificate CA names sent
	---
	SSL handshake has read 0 bytes and written 176 bytes
	...

Clearly, my server was not responding because its certificate was not correctly configured. Another indication of this was when I ran the command:
	service dovecot status

And got this:
	dovecot[15625]: imap-login: Fatal: Can't load ssl_cert: There is no valid PEM certificate.
	dovecot[15623]: master: Error: service(imap-login): command startup failed, throttling for 2 secs

So the certificate that I had generated was not acceptable to dovecot. Quite the demanding little package if you ask me. Wandering around the internet in search of a possible solution, I reached the [official documentation](https://wiki.dovecot.org/FrontPage), somewhere I should have visited much earlier, and got this guide on [SSL certificate creation](https://wiki.dovecot.org/SSL/CertificateCreation). Turns out they are not so bad as they had created a script just to create the certificate. Following their instructions, I executed their script but unfortunately even that gave the error:
	unable to get 'local.nebero' section

So I searched again for this error, but nothing much showed up. Finally some more useless attempts to search for a solution online, I decided to run the commands in the script, but manually one by one. So I executed:
	openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out dovecot.pem -keyout dovecot.key.pem

Which is slightly different from the one given in the guide. I will discuss about this difference in a different blog where we will discuss this whole process of setting up the mail server. Finally I restarted the services and connecting from my local system I got this beautiful output:

	sudhanshu@dubey:~$ openssl s_client -connect local.nebero:993
	CONNECTED(00000003)
	...
	---
	* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=LOGIN] Dovecot ready.

But a login attempt failed:

	* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=LOGIN] Dovecot ready.
	a login use1@local.nebero <password>
	a NO [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Authentication failed.
	a login root@local.nebero <password>
	a NO [AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Authentication failed.
	* BYE Disconnected for inactivity.
	closed

Searching again for possible causes for this, I tried to create a new user and found the reason. The strange command that the guide was using to create users:
	cat << EOF >> /etc/dovecot/users
 
 Was actually at fault. It was, for some strange reason, not putting whole of hashed password in the file. So I removed all the data from the file and manually entered the users and password. Which finally enabled me to successfully login using ssl:

	* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=LOGIN] Dovecot ready.
	a login suraj@local.nebero user@123
	a OK [...] 
	a logout
	* BYE Logging out
	a OK Logout completed (0.000 + 0.000 secs).
	closed

But then again, the mail was not sent:

	sudhanshu@dubey:~$  echo "Subject: sendmail test" | sendmail -v suraj@local.nebero
	...
	250-dubey Hello localhost [127.0.0.1], pleased to meet you
	...
	550 5.1.1 <suraj@local.nebero>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table
	554 5.5.1 Error: no valid recipients
	...

Tired as I was at that time I left the day at this. Also, the beautiful rainy weather was calling out for me so I had no other option. And while I enjoy the sweet breeze outside, you guys can enjoy this comic:
