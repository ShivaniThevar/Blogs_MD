<h1 id="day-30-of-summer-internship">Day 30 of Summer Internship</h1>
<p><em>Date: July 9th, 2019</em></p>
<p>One of the first things that I did today was to test the model that I had updated yesterday. It took around 10 mins for the code to process 5588 mails. And was I satisfied with the results? Damn yes!</p>
<p>I can’t really state a particular % of accuracy because the tested mails were my mails from GMail’s servers and though you may call them “ham” mails, but there were some offers and promotion mail. And it was precisely these mails that my code labelled as <em>spam</em>.</p>
<p>So with this, we were done with coding right? Wrong. Yeah, the major part was finished but there were still bits and pieces left here and there that could be improved. This was mostly the exception handling part like checking for existence of files and directories before operating on them and other similar stuff. And with every small part completed, the documentation was also being updated. After all that was done, I returned to file from where it all started, the model building and training code. It was not updated with the latest changes and documentation. So I sat down to modify it. The first thing that I did was to put all it’s code in a single file. Though not really a good practise, but to cut improve on performance criteria I had to upload all the required modules only once and not multiple times like what it was doing earlier. Simultaneously, I was adding and updating the documentation of the methods inside this file. After that, I modified the way of operation of this file. Earlier, everything was hardcoded into it. I modified it so that it would take command line inputs and then work accordingly. All of this took a considerable amount of time but was worth it.</p>
<p>After all was done, I built a dummy model just to test the speed and performance of the new code. And it built the model from 6017 mails in 22 mins which is approx 4.5 seconds for each mail. This in my opinion is a very good performance. I didn’t tested the model though as it would require a bit too much work and it was late and I wasn’t in the mood (the main reason being this). Talking about speed and measurement of performance, here is an ode to one of the “greatest” speed and performance measuring piece of software:</p>
