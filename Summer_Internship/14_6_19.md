# Day 10 of Summer Internship

*Date: June 14th, 2019*

So I continued to setup my mail server using this [guide](https://appbead.com/blog/how-to-setup-mail-server-on-debian-8-jessie-with-postfix-dovecot-1.html) but leaving the parts related to SSL certificate. Like I used IMAP and not IMAPS, thus setting up port 143 and not 993.

But soon enough, I ran into trouble. The tests mentioned in the guide were not giving positive results and I couldn't determine whether I was doing the right things or not. I consulted my head and he said that rather than using no certificate I should use a self-signed certificate. Less security is better than no security.

So I did that, followed the tutorial again, this time setting things up for a self-signed certificate. Using IMAPS and port 993. Things were going good and tests were being cleared until the point where I had to create a user. I encountered a strange command that I had never seen before:

	cat << EOF >> /etc/dovecot/users

Now I know cat as the concatenation command, ">>" as the append output stream redirector, /etc/dovecot/users as the file name, but what was "<< EOF". Searching on the internet, I found out that "<< EOF" is a way handling multi-line input to a command of script. "<< EOF" makes it so that the input is accepted until "EOF" is encountered. A better explanation can be found [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1003760/what-does-eof-do).

After playing around with the command, I continued my work on the mail server. But to not much success as I was stuck with testing the mail user that I had created. The openssl command mentioned in the guide didn't worked. Neither did [doveadm auth](https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Tools/Doveadm/Auth) nor [doveadmn user](https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Tools/Doveadm/User). So I was kinda left with a blank. I didn't knew what to do next. I gave the stressful job a pause and indulged in other activities. 

Let's see what I will do tomorrow. And not to forget our daily Linux comic:

Sudo has your back, but only if you are in the sudoers file. Otherwise it will report to santa.
