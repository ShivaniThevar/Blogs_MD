<h1 id="day-19-of-summer-internship">Day 19 of Summer Internship</h1>
<p><em>Date: June 26st, 2019</em></p>
<p>So yesterday we got some 2000+ (2854 to be precise) real mails to classify as ham or spam. Now as I mentioned yesterday, they were real mails and had many things other than just the body. So we can’t just take them and start processing. We need to pre-processes them, extract only the relevant part from them. I carefully examined the mails, looked at its structure and tried to understand it. I found one thing, there was one parameter called “boundary”. The value assigned to this parameter was supposed to act like the boundary of the main relevant content of the mail. It looked something like this:</p>
<pre><code>boundary=&quot;69d319ebe47e14d634f20dc58acad4af_b6f3_a0680&quot;</code></pre>
<p>So for that particular mail, wherever <code>69d ... 0680</code> is written, is a boundary and separates different contents. I thought about utilising this “boundary” parameter to extract the main content. But then something struck me. “Hey, I am using Python! There ought to be something out there made for this, some package, some module.” I searched online, and indeed I was right. There is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html">email</a> package meant to handle emails in python. I decided to use it. You would use the <code>get_payload()</code> method to skip the headers and get your main content of the email. But here was the tricky part, while some mails worked fine, other reported the following error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: Argument &#39;string&#39; has incorrect type (expected str, got list)</code></pre>
<p>This was thrown by spacy’s tokeniser. It was expecting a string to tokenise but got a list. Reading the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.compat32-message.html#email.message.Message.get_payload">documentation</a>, I got this: &quot; Return the current payload, which will be a list of Message objects when is_multipart() is True, or a string when is_multipart() is False. If the payload is a list and you mutate the list object, you modify the message’s payload in place.&quot; So my emails were multipart. But what is a <a href="http://www.enewsletterpro.com/articles/multi_part_mime_messages.asp">multipart email</a>? Basically its an email containing different types of content like plain text, HTML, images, attachments, etc. And these are the real emails that we get. So what I had to do was, if the email is multipart, I had to iterate over each part separately. Ok, not much of a big deal. I did that and it worked, but only for some emails. After a few emails, I got the above error again. There were parts in the parts of the mail!! Damn! But that’s fine, I can handle nested loops. I added a loop inside my first loop. Cool, it processed some more emails. So far so good. But then again there was that email that caused the same error. There were parts of the parts of the parts of the mail. Who is watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception">Inception</a> here!! I mean its a nice movie, I like it but not in my code.</p>
<p>Before adding another loop, I realised that that’s not right. I can’t keep adding loops inside loops. I will never know when an email with more level of inception would come and screw it up. I had to think of something else, because otherwise I would have gotten stuck like this guy here:</p>
