<p><em>Date: July 5th, 2019</em></p>
<p>Now it was time to look at my mail server from a user’s perspective. I asked my head that what kind of software do they use to provide the user interface. He said that it was a web based software but was a mixture of a few softwares. He advised me to use <a href="https://roundcube.net/">RoundCube</a>. I installed with the command:</p>
<pre><code>apt install roundcube</code></pre>
<p><code>sudo</code> wasn’t required because I was already the root of the server. During the installation, it would ask you for a database to be installed and configured on the server. So I had already installed MariaDB server on the server using the command:</p>
<pre><code>apt install mariadb-server
systemctl enable mariadb
systemctl start mariadb</code></pre>
<p>The last two commands are two be used if the Mariadb server hasn’t automatically started after installation. So, when Roundcube asked to automatically configure itself for the database, I pressed yes and then it asked for a password for its databse user. After that, Roundcube was installed and now it was time to configure it.</p>
<p>I first created an alias in apache so that we can use Roundcube through the browser. For that I added the following line in 000-default.conf file on apache:</p>
<pre><code>Document Root   /var/www/html   # Line already present
Alias /mail /var/share/roundcube    # Line I added</code></pre>
<p>After restarting the apache server, I was able to see Roundcube running on <code>&lt;ip&gt;/mail</code>. Then, I modified the configuration file of Roundcube which was present in /etc/roundcube/defaults.inc.php. The configuration file is written in pure <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>. I added the details of SMTP server(Postfix) and my IMAP server(Dovecot) like their domain name and ports. I used the ports that were using SSL. After all was said and done. I tried to login as the only user of on that mail server with the name “suraj”. And it failed! I tried with various combination of server names and usernames but it just wasn’t working. With the server name as localhost, /i was getting this error in Roundcube’s logs:</p>
<pre><code>IMAP Error: Login failed for suraj@local.nebero from 10.1.1.111. Empty startup greeting</code></pre>
<p>This actually meant that Rouncube was expecting some kind of response from Dovecot, like an OK or Hey or something. But Dovecot was just sitting silently like an angry adult. The internet said that specifying <code>ssl://</code> before the server name would solve the problem but it didn’t.And still I was able to login to Dovecot with our old method of using Openssl. So it was just a miscommunication between Dovecot and Roundcube, and I guess that’s why Dovecot was behaving like an angry adult because miscommunication is the root of most adult problems.</p>
<p>Anyway, somewhere it was suggested to try Thunderbird and so I did. And guess what, it worked!!! Even though Thunderbird was using the insecure port 143, it just worked and Thunderbird got all the mails of suraj. And one thing that I noticed was that Thunderbird had recieved the emails, they were moved from “new” directory to “cur” directory even if they weren’t “read” yet.</p>
<p>But in Thunderbird, there was no facility to mark a mail as spam. There may be plugins available for that, but it was too late to search for them and try them. And it’s too late to learn C++ in 21 days:</p>
