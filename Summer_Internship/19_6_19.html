<h1 id="day-13-of-summer-internship">Day 13 of Summer Internship</h1>
<p><em>Date: June 19th, 2019</em></p>
<p>With the Cuttlefish in my hand, I tried sending mails to my newly created mail server again and again but each time it was getting rejected by Postfix. The only good part about this was that Postfix is not a girl, otherwise getting rejected so many times would have definitely depressed me. So everytime my mails would get rejected, I would go and check out the logs for the reason. On a side note, it would have been so good if girls also had this log feature so everytime a boy would get rejected, he could check the log and see for possible reasons. But then again, you need root permission to check logs which in the girl scenario would translate to “best friend permission”. Anyway, the logs would show the same error message the we got yesterday:</p>
<pre><code> postfix/smtpd[24198]: connect from unknown[10.1.1.111]
 postfix/smtpd[24198]: BC3AF40B47: client=unknown[10.1.1.111]
 postfix/cleanup[24204]: BC3AF40B47: message-id=&lt;201906190608.x5J68hlb011332@dubey&gt;

 postfix/bounce[24206]: BC3AF40B47: sender non-delivery notification: D519640B49
 postfix/qmgr[24178]: BC3AF40B47: removed</code></pre>
<p>But along with these messages, I noticed a warning too:</p>
<pre><code>postfix/trivial-rewrite[12853]: warning: do not list domain local.nebero in BOTH mydestination and virtual_mailbox_domains</code></pre>
<p>Again, it would be so helpful if the girl’s log would contain a warning, possibly like:</p>
<pre><code>girl/denial: error: proposal-id=10992, status=rejected
girl/denial: warning: do not keep &quot;that&quot; hairstyle!</code></pre>
<p>Back to the topic, I searched for the meaning of mydestination and virtual_mailbox_domains so that I may set the correct values for them. Now due to this very helpful feature of Computer Science that the name of everything is in English and relates to its purpose, we could guess the mydestination should contain those domains for which the server is final address, virtual_mailbox_domains should have those domains that aren’t the server’s domain but the server accepts mail for these too. This is true to the most part, but this doesn’t actually justify why keeping local.nebero (my server’s domain) in both the variables should not work. Going over guide again and some other resources, I decided to the keep the values as:</p>
<pre><code>mydestination: localhost
vitual_mailbox_domains: local.nebero</code></pre>
<p>And guess what! It worked!!! My mails finally reached Dovecot through Postfix as the logs indicate:</p>
<pre><code>postfix/smtpd[25254]: connect from unknown[10.1.1.111]
postfix/smtpd[25254]: 9F64240B49: client=unknown[10.1.1.111]

<p>And I could see the files as:</p>
<pre><code>root@bhav:~# ls -lh /var/vmail/local.nebero/suraj/new/
total 8.0K
-rw------- 1 vmail vmail 2.1K Jun 19 14:12 1560933732.M286818P25225.bhav,S=2083,W=2148
-rw------- 1 vmail vmail  838 Jun 19 14:12 1560933768.M735602P25229.bhav,S=838,W=857</code></pre>
<p>I will write another blog to share the whole process of setting up a mail server using Postfix and Dovecot. So finally, I had installed and properly configured my own mail server (Yay) !!! Now I could finally go back to the python part. We must remember that setting up a mail server was not a direct part of the project. Its just an environment the we need to test the working of our project.</p>
<p>But still, there is one part left that we need to figure out. Which are the “new” mails??? Our spam filter should only read the new mails as they come, possibly before they reach the inbox. Now normally the softwares have file naming conventions and mostly use the date and time of the file creation to name them, but looking at file names above, there is just no pattern or atleast I can’t find any.</p>
<p>So I spent the rest of the day searching for a way to detect “new” mails in Dovecot, but couldn’t find anything anything helpful except this:</p>

<p>Told ya, you need that root permission to get things done.</p>
