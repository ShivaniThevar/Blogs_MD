# Day 24 of Summer Internship

*Date: July 2nd, 2019*

Now I had to get my mails from Gmail's servers. For this, my head had suggested me to use [imapsync](https://imapsync.lamiral.info/). While promising, this software was neither free nor open-source. So I decided to search for other ways. The obvious answer was to use [POP3 protocol](https://whatismyipaddress.com/pop3). But just deciding the protocol won't get me my mails, I have to use an application that implements that protocol. For that, I found 2 candidates, [fetchmail](http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-man.html) and Mozilla's Thunderbird. Going the cli way, I tried to use fetchmail. But fetchmail was trying to forward the mails somewhere which it wasn't able to do, and thus was giving errors. Not finding a quick solution to this, I switched to Thunderbird, which worked fine. But there was one problem, rather than storing each mail in a separate file, it was storing all the mails in a single file. Not something I required. Downloading the mails with "Save As" option did the trick, but there was another issue with that. The name of the file was the subject of the mail, quite logical, but then the subjects were too long thus violating the max length of the file name allowed in Linux. Again, with no quick solution in sight, I went back to fetchmail. Looking around, I now find that if I use maildrop as the MDA (Mail Delivery Agent), I would be able to get my mails. And I did just that, but again the result wasn't satisfactory. Like Thunderbird, it was storing mails in a single file. I had to return to Thunderbird. At this point, I was basically like:

With more research, I found out about the [importexport](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/importexporttools/) addon, which finally solved my problem. So I got around 5588 mails from my own Gmail account. Then I had to send them all to the server where I will put them to test. I thought that I will ``git add`` them and then ``git push`` them to the server. But I guess 5588 mails were a bit too much for git to handle at once. It wasn't responding, so I just [scp](https://haydenjames.io/linux-securely-copy-files-using-scp/)ied them to the server and started the testing of these mails.

It took around 9 mins for the code to process all the mails, which is quite good. But I couldn't really check the accuracy of the results.I knew that it wasn't satisfactory as it had classified most of the mails as spam, which was wrong. But then I do have a lot of mails that can be classified as spam. So I was still uncertain how good the results were. But then I guess it time for me to wrap-up the backend work and shift to the frontend. To test the filter as a user. For this, I would need to setup my code as a continuously running service. This would probably require a loop. Loops are a great programming tool, and I wish I would have known them earlier so that I could have avoid punishments like these:
